# ProPR Desktop

This workspace packages the existing `propr-ui` React source as a sandboxed Electron renderer. The desktop entry is
`propr-ui/src/desktop.tsx`; the normal web entry, service worker, CLI, API, and self-hosted deployment remain unchanged.

## Commands

Run these from the repository root:

```sh
npm run desktop:dev
npm run desktop:typecheck
npm run desktop:test
npm run desktop:package
npm run desktop:smoke # Run under xvfb-run on a headless Linux host.
npm run desktop:make
npm run desktop:audit
# On Linux hosts with the corresponding native packaging tools installed:
npm run make:deb -w @propr/desktop
npm run make:rpm -w @propr/desktop
```

The desktop typecheck and package commands build required renderer workspace dependencies through
`desktop:prepare`, so they do not depend on a previously generated `packages/shared/dist` directory.

Development renderer URLs are accepted only when Electron Forge supplies an HTTP loopback URL. Packaged builds load
the generated renderer from the application ASAR through an app-owned protocol.

The packaged-binary smoke test verifies the hardened fuse states, launches the Linux artifact without a
sandbox-disabling flag, rejects main-process uncaught exceptions, and requires proof that `window.proprDesktop` is
exposed before accepting renderer-ready and a clean exit.

`desktop:audit` deliberately applies separate policies to the two dependency surfaces: low-or-higher advisories fail
the production-runtime audit, while high and critical advisories fail the desktop development/build-tool audit. Release
CI runs both checks directly from the committed lockfile before installing or executing the packaging toolchain.

## Security boundary

The renderer has no Node.js integration and receives only the typed `window.proprDesktop` bridge. It exposes metadata,
validated external-browser opening, profiles, encrypted credentials, lifecycle placeholders, and validated deep-link
events. It never exposes a shell, command runner, arbitrary IPC call, or filesystem path/API.

Profile metadata is stored in an app-owned, permission-restricted JSON file. Credential values are encrypted with
Electron `safeStorage` before they are written separately. If OS encryption is unavailable—or Linux selects the
`basic_text` backend—the app reports that state and refuses to persist or return credentials; there is no plaintext
fallback. Profiles remain usable because they contain only a display label and validated API endpoint.

`propr://connect` and `propr://open` are the only accepted deep-link actions. A single-instance lock routes later
activations to the existing window. Local lifecycle methods intentionally return `not-implemented`; this scaffold does
not download, install, start, or execute ProPR runtime components.
